      I havent fully committed to a carreer path yet but i am enjoying computer
      science so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lived in Utah and Colorado and I served a mission in the Japan
      Tokyo North Mission
    </p>
    <p>
      I love fishing, hunting, hiking and basically anything else outdoors as
      well as basketball and most other sprts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can see webdesign being a great skill to know for helping out businesses
      or if i were to one day start my own business then i would be able to
      design a website for it which would just help it seem that much more
      professional.

      i have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since i was a boy. I
      dont have a favorite quote but i have always loved listening to the words
      of Thomas S. Monson. My favoorite scripture right now is from the Book of
      Mormon its Jacoob 4: 13
